# e3-lite
e3-lite is an adaptation of the original "killians e3 macro".  

Requires mq2moveutils, mq2collections, mq2cast, mq2nav, and probably a few others. 

To use, just run /mac e3.  The first time you execute the macro, a basic INI will be created.  Below explains all the areas and what you can do with them.
